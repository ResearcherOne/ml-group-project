   "Devices  for  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  are  deployed  in  ",
   "households,  factories  and  cities.  Devices  such  as  fridges,  ",
   "thermometers and various sensors and actuators usually do not ",
   "contain  protection  software.  These  devices  can  be  protected  ",
   "by network Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention ",
   "System (IDS/IPS) which is a defense system whose task is to ",
   "monitor  network  traffic.  IDS  tools  only  write  to  the  log  file  ",
   "when the attack is detected. IPS can block the threat by packet ",
   "jams  or  blocking  the  connection.  IPS  provides  protection  of  ",
   "devices not only in the IoT against takeover attempts, but also ",
   "against malicious use [1].  ",
   "IDS/IPS  tools  can  be  divided  to  anomaly-based  and  ",
   "signature-based.   Anomaly-based   tools   compare   the   data   ",
   "deviations   and   behavior   of   network   traffic   against   the   ",
   "statistically normal network state or profile [1]. The advantage ",
   "of  this  approach  is  the  ability  to  detect  previously  unknown  ",
   "attacks. Signature-based tools detect and distinguish between ",
   "common  system  states  and  databases  of  known  traces  and  ",
   "patterns  suggesting  a  penetration  attempt.  The  advantage  of  ",
   "signature-based  detection  is  a  low  error  rate,  but  it  cannot  ",
   "detect an undefined type of attack. Additionally, systems can ",
   "be classified as Host Based IDS HIDS (Host Based IDS) and ",
   "Network  Based  IDS  (NIDS)  [2].  HIDS  is  running  on  one  ",
   "device  and  provides  protection  for  a  single  machine.  It  ",
   "monitors not only inbound and outbound traffic, but also the ",
   "whole  system  (kernel  and  system  behavior).  NIDS  monitors  ",
   "network  traffic,  most  often  operated  on  a  perimeter  network  ",
   "[3].  Each  IDS/IPS  system  generally  consists  of  a  sensor,  a  ",
   "configuration   database,   a   known   attack   database,   and   a   ",
   "module that performs an action. The most common network ",
   "attacks  are  port  scanning,  specific  packet  response  testing,  ",
   "DNS  spoofing,  eavesdropping,  unauthorized  connections,  or  ",
   "communication with non-standard IP addresses. Additionally, ",
   "bugs  in  specific  application  protocols,  various  DOS  attacks,  ",
   "identity falsifications, and more [2]. It is important to test IPS ",
   "against network attacks and thereby verify its protection. The ",
   "types of network attacks are described in [4]. It also presents ",
   "description of IPS types and their location and new approaches ",
   "and  techniques  used  in  IPS  tools.  Authors  in  [5]  deals  with  ",
   "web-based  interfaces  testing,  system  testing,  it  describes  ",
   "cryptographic issues due to low message entropy, which are ",
   "sent between the devices. An overview of different intrusion ",
   "detection  systems  and  comparison  of  functions  of  Snort,  ",
   "Suricata and Bro IDS is presented in [1]. The performance of ",
   "the  three  IDS  under  different  traffic  rates  and  attacks  is  ",
   "presented in [6]. Authors in [7] describe implementation with ",
   "tool Basic Analysis and Security Engine (BASE). BASE is a ",
   "web    interface    written    in    PHP    which    provides    alert    ",
   "management  and  analysis  engine  for  detected  incidents.  It  ",
   "supports  IDS/IPS  as  well  as  network  components  such  as  ",
   "routers and firewalls. ",

   "Main  contribution  of  the  paper  is  the  presented  testing  ",
   "method  for  Suricata  IPS  and  the  comparison  of  its  response  ",
   "implemented on the embedded platform to various tools and ",
   "types of network attacks. The rest of the paper is organized as ",
   "follows: The section II deals with testing of IDS/IPS, section ",
   "III describes the penetration testing of Suricata IPS. Results of ",
   "penetration  testing  are  presented  in  chapter  IV.  Conclusions  ",
